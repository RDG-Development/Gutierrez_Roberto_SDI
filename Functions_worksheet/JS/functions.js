/*Comment each line of code appropriately. Comment, comment, comment!
 Write the givens as variables, and pass the givens to the function using arguments.
 The calculations should be within the functions and the function should return the result to the result variable.
 Create a variable for your result (donâ€™t forget!)
 Print the result using the result variable and the appropriate message outside the function. (Do not print from the functions you create)
 There should be a minimum of 20 commits to your git repository.
 This should all be done in a single project and single .as file.
